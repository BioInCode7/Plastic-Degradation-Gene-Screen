- Low duplication rate (~1.6%)
- High base quality (Q30 >94%)
- GC content ~64%, consistent with enriched environmental microbiomes

These results indicate high-quality input data suitable for metagenomic assembly.


## Metagenome assembly (SRR28167100)

- Assembler: MEGAHIT v1.2.9
- Preset: meta-sensitive
- Minimum contig length: 1 kb
- Total assembled size: 234.6 Mb
- Number of contigs: 66,727
- N50: 6.3 kb
- Longest contig: 1.77 Mb

The assembly shows typical fragmentation for complex landfill microbiomes
and is suitable for downstream gene prediction and functional screening.
