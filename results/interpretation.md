# Interpretation of results

This document provides a qualitative interpretation of the results generated by the pipeline.
All interpretations are exploratory and refer to genetic potential only.

## Overview of detected candidates

Screening of the SRR28167100 metagenome resulted in:

- X genes with significant similarity to PlasticDB entries
- Y genes with significant similarity to PAZy enzymes
- Z genes supported by both databases
- X−Z genes detected exclusively via PlasticDB

This separation allows explicit distinction between high-confidence enzymatic matches and broader, putative plastic-associated genes.

## High-confidence candidates (PAZy-supported)

Genes matching PAZy entries represent homologs of enzymes that have been biochemically characterized to act on synthetic polymers, mainly PET and PUR.

Most PAZy-supported hits in this dataset are associated with PET degradation, consistent with the current bias of experimentally validated plastic-degrading enzymes toward ester-based polymers.

These candidates represent the strongest evidence for plastic-degradation-related genetic potential in the analyzed metagenome.

## PlasticDB-only candidates: the grey zone

A substantial fraction of detected genes showed significant similarity to PlasticDB entries but lacked support from PAZy.

These genes fall into a grey zone:
- they are associated with plastic degradation in the literature
- but lack direct biochemical validation

Such candidates may include:
- distant homologs of known enzymes
- enzymes acting on plastic additives or oligomers
- multifunctional hydrolases with broad substrate ranges

While these hits cannot be interpreted as confirmed plastic-degrading enzymes, they represent promising targets for further prioritization and comparative analyses.

## Interpretation boundaries

All results should be interpreted with caution:

- Sequence similarity does not imply functional activity
- Environmental context and expression are unknown
- Polymer crystallinity and accessibility are not considered
- No taxonomic or genomic context is provided

This analysis should therefore be viewed as a hypothesis-generating screen rather than functional confirmation.

## Why these results are useful

Despite these limitations, the results provide:
- a transparent inventory of plastic-associated genetic potential
- a clear separation between confidence levels
- a reproducible framework for comparative screening across datasets

This enables rational prioritization of environments and candidate genes for downstream experimental or computational studies.
