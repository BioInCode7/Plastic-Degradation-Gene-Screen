# Interpretation of results

This document provides a qualitative interpretation of the results generated by the pipeline.
All interpretations are exploratory and refer to genetic potential only.

## 1. Scope and interpretation limits

All results presented here should be interpreted with caution:

- Sequence similarity does not imply functional activity
- Environmental context and gene expression are unknown
- Polymer crystallinity and accessibility are not considered
- No taxonomic or genomic context is provided

This analysis should therefore be viewed as a hypothesis-generating screen rather than functional confirmation.

## 2. Overview of detected candidates

Screening of the SRR28167100 metagenome revealed a substantial number of genes with significant similarity to PlasticDB entries and a smaller, more conservative set of genes matching PAZy enzymes, with partial overlap between both databases.

This separation allows an explicit distinction between high-confidence enzymatic evidence and broader, putative plastic-associated genetic potential, as summarized in the comparative results table.

This separation allows explicit distinction between high-confidence enzymatic matches and broader, putative plastic-associated genes.

## 3. High-confidence candidates (PAZy-supported)

Genes matching PAZy entries represent homologs of enzymes that have been biochemically characterized to act on synthetic polymers, mainly PET and PUR.

Most PAZy-supported hits in this dataset are associated with PET degradation, consistent with the current experimental bias toward ester-based polymers in plastic biodegradation research.

These candidates represent the strongest evidence for plastic-degradation-related genetic potential in the analyzed metagenome.

## 4. PlasticDB-only candidates: definition of the grey zone

A substantial fraction of detected genes showed significant similarity to PlasticDB entries but lacked support from PAZy.

These genes fall into a “grey zone”:
- they are associated with plastic degradation in the literature
- but lack direct biochemical validation against synthetic polymers

Such candidates may include:
- distant homologs of known plastic-active enzymes
- enzymes acting on plastic additives or oligomers
- multifunctional hydrolases with broad substrate ranges

## 5. Functional composition of the grey zone

PlasticDB-only high-confidence candidates were not randomly distributed across functional annotations.
Instead, they showed a strong enrichment in enzyme families previously implicated in plastic degradation, including:

- lipases
- esterases
- hydrolases
- PETase-like enzymes
- copper-dependent oxidases (e.g. laccases)

This functional coherence supports the biological plausibility of these candidates despite the lack of direct biochemical validation.

## 6. Prioritization of top candidates

To facilitate downstream analyses, a subset of PlasticDB-only candidates was prioritized based on stricter similarity criteria (≥45% amino acid identity and ≥80% query coverage).

These high-confidence grey-zone candidates represent promising targets for:
- comparative screening across environments
- structural or evolutionary analyses
- future functional validation experiments

## 7. Why these results are useful

Despite their limitations, these results provide:

- a transparent inventory of plastic-associated genetic potential
- a clear separation between confidence levels
- an explicit treatment of uncertainty
- a reproducible framework for comparative screening across metagenomes

This approach enables rational prioritization of environments and candidate genes without overinterpreting sequence similarity as functional proof.

## 8. Environmental contrast: enriched vs non-enriched systems

To evaluate whether plastic exposure shapes the genetic potential for plastic biodegradation, the workflow was applied to two contrasting metagenomic datasets:

- a plastic-enriched cow dung microbial consortium (SRR28167100)
- a natural wetland sediment metagenome without known plastic enrichment (SRR24575585)

Despite their different environmental contexts, both metagenomes contained a comparable number of PAZy-supported hits, indicating that biochemically validated plastic-active enzymes are broadly distributed across microbial ecosystems.

In contrast, high-confidence PlasticDB hits were strongly enriched in the plastic-exposed system, suggesting that plastic enrichment promotes the expansion of genes associated with polymer degradation even under relatively strict similarity thresholds.

The largest divergence between environments was observed in the PlasticDB grey-zone category. This indicates that ecological adaptation to plastics is primarily reflected in the expansion of putative or uncharacterized enzymatic functions rather than in the proliferation of already known plastic-degrading enzymes.

Together, these observations support a model in which plastic exposure amplifies latent functional diversity rather than introducing entirely novel enzymatic capabilities.
