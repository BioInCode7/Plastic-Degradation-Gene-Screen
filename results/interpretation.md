# Interpretation of results

This document provides a qualitative interpretation of the results generated by the pipeline.
All interpretations are exploratory and refer to genetic potential only.

## 1. Scope and interpretation limits

All results presented here should be interpreted with caution:

- Sequence similarity does not imply functional activity
- Environmental context and gene expression are unknown
- Polymer crystallinity and accessibility are not considered
- No taxonomic or genomic context is provided

This analysis should therefore be viewed as a hypothesis-generating screen rather than functional confirmation.

## 2. Overview of detected candidates

Screening of the SRR28167100 metagenome resulted in:

- X predicted genes with significant similarity to PlasticDB entries
- Y predicted genes with significant similarity to PAZy enzymes
- Z genes supported by both databases
- X−Z genes detected exclusively via PlasticDB

This separation allows explicit distinction between high-confidence enzymatic matches and broader, putative plastic-associated genes.

## 3. High-confidence candidates (PAZy-supported)

Genes matching PAZy entries represent homologs of enzymes that have been biochemically characterized to act on synthetic polymers, mainly PET and PUR.

Most PAZy-supported hits in this dataset are associated with PET degradation, consistent with the current experimental bias toward ester-based polymers in plastic biodegradation research.

These candidates represent the strongest evidence for plastic-degradation-related genetic potential in the analyzed metagenome.

## 4. PlasticDB-only candidates: definition of the grey zone

A substantial fraction of detected genes showed significant similarity to PlasticDB entries but lacked support from PAZy.

These genes fall into a “grey zone”:
- they are associated with plastic degradation in the literature
- but lack direct biochemical validation against synthetic polymers

Such candidates may include:
- distant homologs of known plastic-active enzymes
- enzymes acting on plastic additives or oligomers
- multifunctional hydrolases with broad substrate ranges

## 5. Functional composition of the grey zone

PlasticDB-only high-confidence candidates were not randomly distributed across functional annotations.
Instead, they showed a strong enrichment in enzyme families previously implicated in plastic degradation, including:

- lipases
- esterases
- hydrolases
- PETase-like enzymes
- copper-dependent oxidases (e.g. laccases)

This functional coherence supports the biological plausibility of these candidates despite the lack of direct biochemical validation.

## 6. Prioritization of top candidates

To facilitate downstream analyses, a subset of PlasticDB-only candidates was prioritized based on stricter similarity criteria (≥45% amino acid identity and ≥80% query coverage).

These high-confidence grey-zone candidates represent promising targets for:
- comparative screening across environments
- structural or evolutionary analyses
- future functional validation experiments

## 7. Why these results are useful

Despite their limitations, these results provide:

- a transparent inventory of plastic-associated genetic potential
- a clear separation between confidence levels
- an explicit treatment of uncertainty
- a reproducible framework for comparative screening across metagenomes

This approach enables rational prioritization of environments and candidate genes without overinterpreting sequence similarity as functional proof.
